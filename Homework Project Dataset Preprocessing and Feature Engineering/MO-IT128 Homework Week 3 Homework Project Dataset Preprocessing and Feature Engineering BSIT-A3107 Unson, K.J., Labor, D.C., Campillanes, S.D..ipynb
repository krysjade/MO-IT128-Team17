    "# Data Preprocessing Decisions\n",
    "- Transaction dates were converted to a standard datetime format to enable time-based analysis and feature creation.\n",
    "- Missing numerical values in transaction amounts and customer satisfaction scores were handled using median imputation to minimize the influence of extreme values and preserve overall data distribution.\n",
    "- Extreme transaction amounts were capped at the 99th percentile to reduce the impact of outliers on aggregated customer spending metrics.\n",
    "- Customer satisfaction scores were clipped to a maximum value of 10 to ensure consistency with the expected rating scale.\n",
    "- Duplicate records were removed from all datasets to maintain data integrity, using unique identifiers such as Transaction_ID and Product_ID.\n",
    "- Non-essential or redundant fields (e.g., target age group in the product dataset) were removed to simplify the dataset and focus on analytically relevant attributes.\n",
    "- Datasets were aggregated and merged at the customer level to support customer-centric analysis aligned with FinMark’s business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Engineering Decisions\n",
    "- Transaction data was aggregated per customer to generate key behavioral metrics, including total spend, average transaction value, transaction frequency, and number of unique transaction types.\n",
    "- A recency feature was created by calculating the number of days since a customer’s most recent transaction, enabling analysis of customer engagement over time.\n",
    "- The most frequent transaction type per customer was identified to capture primary customer behavior patterns.\n",
    "- Customer feedback data was aggregated to compute average satisfaction and likelihood-to-recommend scores.\n",
    "- For customers without feedback records, missing feedback metrics were filled using median values to retain these customers in downstream analysis.\n",
    "- A High Spender indicator was created based on the top 25% of total customer spending to support segmentation and targeting use cases.\n",
    "- A Loyalty Index was engineered by combining customer satisfaction and transaction frequency, reflecting both engagement and sentiment in a single metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Export\n",
    "- Cleaned datasets and the engineered customer feature dataset were exported as CSV files to support reproducibility and downstream modeling or reporting tasks."
